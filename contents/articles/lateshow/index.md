When David Letterman switched networks from NBC to CBS, CBS bought the theater in February 1993 for $4.5 million from Winthrop Financial Associates of Boston.

The theater was reconfigured into a 400-seat studio, with lighting and sound adjustments. The architectural firm that did the work, Polshek Partnership, notes on its web site that "to preserve the architectural integrity of the landmark, all interventions are reversible."

In 2005, it took nearly four months to retrofit the theater with the cabling and equipment necessary to broadcast high definition television.[citation needed]

When Stephen Colbert inherits Late Show following Letterman's impending 2015 retirement, the show will continue to be broadcast from the Ed Sullivan Theater, although a renovation will occur between the two hosts' tenures.
