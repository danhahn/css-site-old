The theater served as a stage for The Rosie O'Donnell Show for a week of shows in October 1996 when several eighth-floor studios at NBC's 30 Rockefeller Center headquarters experienced complications from an electrical fire.

In the 21st century, the theater has hosted roof-top or marquee-top concerts by a few musicians:

* Dave Matthews Band on July 15, 2002
* Phish on June 21, 2004
* Paul McCartney on July 15, 2009
* Eminem and Jay-Z in June 2010

On February 9, 2014, the 50th anniversary of the Beatles' first Ed Sullivan performance, CBS News hosted a roundtable discussion at the theater. Anthony Mason will moderate the panel, which consists of Pattie Boyd, Neil Innes, Mick Jones, Tad Kubler, John Oates, Andrew Oldham, Nile Rodgers and Julie Taymor. A replica of the marquee to the theater as it looked the night of the original performance also covered up the present-day marquee over the weekend.
